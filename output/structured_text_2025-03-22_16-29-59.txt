On May 15, 2017, Amazon.com celebrated the 20th anniversary of its initial public offering (IPO). Over the preceding two decades, Amazon had grown from a small e-commerce startup to the fourth largest U.S. public company, trailing only Apple, Alphabet (Google’s parent), and Microsoft. The company reached such a size, however, with little to show in terms of profitability. Amazon chose to invest in expansion and research and development with the idea that sacrificing profit in the short term would allow the company to maximize profit in the long term.

### Company Background  

Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos. Before starting Amazon, Bezos worked in New York as a vice president at D. E. Shaw & Co., a global investment management firm. However, he decided to quit his job and move to Seattle to leverage the incredible growth of the Internet. The Amazon website launched on July 16, 1995.

Amazon started as an online bookstore but employed innovative strategies that set it apart from competitors. It offered discounts up to 30%, allowed customers to post their own book reviews on its website, and continually improved the ordering process with features like “1-Click” shopping. These strategies derived from Amazon’s customer-centric mission statement:  

> “Our vision is to be the Earth’s most customer-centric company; to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online.”

On May 15, 1997, Amazon’s IPO, priced at $18 a share, raised $54 million. By day’s end, the company’s stock closed up 30% at $23.50, yielding a market capitalization of $438 million. The stock price increased by 7,000% over the years but fell 95% from its peak during the dot-com crash. Throughout this tumultuous period, Amazon branched out into other product categories such as CDs, DVDs, consumer electronics, video games, software, and office products.
